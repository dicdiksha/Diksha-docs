## Overview

DIKSHA offers certificates after you complete a recommended course. The course details card specifies if the course offers a certificate. Certificate are issued on completion of the course with the criteria of merit and best score of the user. An email or SMS is sent to the user when the certificate issued. The users can view them on the profile page.  

 Users can verify their certificate by scanning the QR code printed on the certificate with your mobile app.  After verifying the certificate, users can publish them on their profile. They are then visible to other users. Registered users can view and download the certificates in PDF and PNG formats. 


This section provides detailed instructions to view and download certificates for completed courses.

- An exisiting certificate that was attached to a course may get edited or updated at a later date. In such a scenario, users who have already completed the course and received the certificate will not receive the  updated certificate . Users can contact their state administrators for further details
