## Overview

DIKSHA offers a wide range of courses. After you log in, you can join the course on your own, or your organization may invite you to join the course. The course categories are:  

- **My courses**: This category displays the list of courses that you have undertaken, have partially completed or recently joined. This list also includes the courses that you have been invited to join. You can view your enrolled courses based on enrolment date and locate your courses easily.  

- **My State's courses**: This category displays the list of State-specific courses that are created and uploaded by the user's State. This list is visible only to users registered in that specific State. If you log in as an authenticated State user, you can join the course for any batch that is open for enrolment. The list displays the most recently created course at the top.  

- **Featured courses**: This category displays all available courses, irrespective of the organization that created it. Any logged-in user can join the course shown in this category.   

- **Latest courses**: This category displays a list of the courses most recently added to DIKSHA.  

The guidelines to take the courses vary for each course. The creator or mentor decides the guidelines applicable for that specific course.

## Completing a Course

On DIKSHA, there are two types of courses, those with certificates and those with no certificates. A note is displayed on the course details page to indicate if the course has a certificate. On successfully completing a course, a course completion message is displayed. For courses with certificates, details of the certificate are also mentioned. For details on downloading course certificate refer <a href="./course-certificates.html" target="_blank">Course Certificates</a>

Courses can also have assessments. Completing the assessments are sometimes determiners to indicate the completion of a course. Course mentors can add assessments at the end of the course or for each module of the course. 
There can be one or many attempts to take the assessment. Each time a user attempts the assessment a message is displayed to notify the remaining attempts for the user. Once the user crosses the permissible attempts, they cannot retake the assessment. Additionally, when the user initiates an assessment, a timer indicates and warns the user for the remaining time before the assessment is automatically submitted.

Some courses are also available within the Digital Textbook section. These course do not have a certificate associated with them and you cannot track the progress of these courses, but you can take them and complete them akin to the courses available in the Courses section.
