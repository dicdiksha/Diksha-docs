## Overview

On Diksha users can create accounts in three ways:
1. Signing with Google Account
2. Signing with State System
3. First Time User Sign up

For more details on account creation, refer <a href="../login/index.html" target="_blank">Sign In</a>

For example, let us consider a user has taken a course on DIKSHA by logging in using either their Google account or self-signed up account. The user now wants to reflect those usage details in his/her state account, in such scenario DIKSHA provides a feature of "Merge Account" using which the user can combine the usage details.

The Merge Account feature enables users to:
- combine the usage details of both the accounts and
- delete the other account from DIKSHA records

Note:
Account merge can be initiated only from a valid active account registered in the State system.


## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a valid email address/phone number registered on DIKSHA with its corresponding password.
