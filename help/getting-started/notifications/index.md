## In-app notifications

In-app notifications are messages or prompts that are sent to active users on both the DIKSHA mobile app and portal. These notifications help users in content search and enable them to discover relevant content

### Admin notifications

Group admins can send notifications to the following: 

- Specific board and user type 
- All users, whether logged in/ guest users
- Users that fit certain specifications 

Additionally, when the group admin sends a notification for users with multiple specifications like board, medium and class, then all users  will receive the notification

### Certificate notifications

DIKSHA offers users a wide range of courses with certification upon completion. The course coordinator can inform the availability of certificates using in-app notification after the user completes a recommended course.  The notification is triggered automatically based on the rules set by the course creator for issuing certificates.
