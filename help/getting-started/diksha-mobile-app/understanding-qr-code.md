## Overview

A QR code is an image with patterns of black and white squares that can be read by an electronic device with a scanner. QR codes are positioned appropriately and printed on the textbooks to make it easier to access the relevant content and understand the topics better. The scan results across all content types (courses, textbooks, individual content).

You can scan the QR code using the DIKSHA mobile app (both registered or guest user) on your

- Smartphone 
- Tablet
- Laptop using Chrome browser

When you scan a QR code of a unit or a content that exists on your device (downloaded) on your device, the QR scan will display relevant content, irrespective of whether you are online or offline.
