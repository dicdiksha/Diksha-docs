Energized Textbook (ETB) is a feature aimed at providing access to digital content for various topics in physical textbooks.
On DIKSHA, books are compiled or curated from school books or any book that conform to syllabi of state or central board (CBSE) or any recognized institution or publication, such as NCERT in the said medium of instruction and language. Based on a predetermined understanding, QR codes are attached to physical textbooks and related content is created on DIKSHA. This document explains the procedure of scanning QR Codes in DIKSHA and accessing related content using QR code. 

## Accessing Digital Content

The digital content can be accessed using QR Codes. To generate a QR Code contact your system administrator. 

 - QR code is formed using patterns of black dots and white spaces along with a six digit unique identifer assigned to a textbook. The QR code associated with the book or content enhances the discoverability of the content or the book. 

You can use the 6-digit code under the QR code under the QR code for DIKSHA content or the 4-digit code for NCERT syllabus instead of scanning the QR code every time you search for the content. For ease of access the QR code is printed on the text book.

If there is one content resource associated to the scanned QR code, you directly see the content details page. If more than one content resource is associated with the same QR code, you see a list of results. You can see results across all content types - courses, textbooks or individual content resources.

When you scan a QR code of a unit or a content that exists on your device (downloaded) on your device, the QR scan will display relevant content, irrespective of whether you are online or offline.
