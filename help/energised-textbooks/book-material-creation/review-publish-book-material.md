### Overview  

Content or the book material on DIKSHA must adhere to standard guidelines to ensure good quality. When a content creator creates the content and sends it for review, the reviewer needs to verify the content for its appropriateness & usability aspects to ensure quality, after which it gets published. Organizations/tenants can assign reviewer roles to users and set guidelines. The content reviewer reviews and publish it on DIKSHA.
If the content fails to achieve the criteria, reject it with comments, and the creator needs to edit the content and re-submit it. The content is available for the users to consume after it is reviewed and published.
