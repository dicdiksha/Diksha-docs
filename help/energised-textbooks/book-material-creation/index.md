### Overview

On DIKSHA; a book is a collection of content units. Each content unit is created separately and compiled to curate a book. The book material (chapters/lessons) must comply with the following:

* It is in the same medium of instruction and language as the book.
* It is an integral part of the book structure. 
* It adheres to the recommended guidelines and exacting reviews before publishing. 

The user must have content creation rights to create book material.  The State Administrators provide registered users with appropriate privileges for creating the material. Before creating book material on DIKSHA, a State User who runs the program must identify the content creators and reviewers in the State. Once the content is published, users can manage the material by adding them to the book structure.

To create the book material on DIKSHA:
* Create a plan and add it to the book   
* Create new content using the inbuilt content editor as a resource  
* Add existing content using the Upload Content option
