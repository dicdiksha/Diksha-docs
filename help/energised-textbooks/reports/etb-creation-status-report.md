### Overview

Single sign-on users are the verified users of a particular State. They have a unique ID the State provides, which is used for logging in to DIKSHA. SSO users get instructions from the State on how to log in. States who do not have a State system or portal have to self-sign up because they do not have a system into which DIKSHA can be integrated.

When the SSO user signs up, the state portal returns a set of fields that DIKSHA uses to create the user account, for example, Name, External User ID, State ID, External school (organisation) ID, and Roles. On being redirected to DIKSHA, the user is prompted to enter their phone number and validate the OTP. After successful validation of OTP, the user can log into DIKSHA.
