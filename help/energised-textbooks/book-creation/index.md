### Overview   

On DIKSHA, a digital textbook is a collection of content units compiled or curated from school books or any book that conforms to the syllabi of the State, Central Board, or any recognized institution or publication. A book must be in the said medium of instruction and language. To create a digital textbook, the user must have book creation rights assigned. The creator can create the digital textbook structure on DIKSHA in two ways:  

* Using book editor and adding relevant units and sub-units one by one 
* Upload entire units and subunits using a CSV file with the relevant structure 
  
In either way of creating the digital textbook structure, add the relevant details for each unit and the book as a whole to the respective sections.
