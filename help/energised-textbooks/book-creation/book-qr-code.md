### Overview

QR codes enhance the searchability and discoverability of the textbooks for learning any online textbook. A QR code consists of a QR image and a DIAL code (unique 6-digit alphanumeric). This is generated while creating the textbook. Once generated, it remains static, irrespective of the edits or rejections of a textbook while publishing, but the content can be dynamically updated. Each generated QR code is linked to a folder or sections in the **Digital textbook**. The same QR code is printed on the textbook and mapped one-on-one to the corresponding folder or section of the **Digital textbook**.

    <th style="width:15%;">Download</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><video width="320" height="240" controls><source src="../videos/generate-link-qr-code.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></td>
    <td class="text-center"><a href="../videos/generate-link-qr-code.mp4" download><img src="../../../assets/imgs/icons/outline_cloud_download.png"></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Additional Notes 

   * The QR code once generated cannot be edited
   * The codes can be generated incrementally as and when needed. One QR code for the entire digital textbook and the rest for other sections.
