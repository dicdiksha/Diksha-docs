### Overview  

A textbook on DIKSHA must adhere to standard guidelines to ensure good quality.  When a Book creator creates the textbook and sends it for review, the reviewer needs to verify the textbook for appropriateness & usability aspects to ensure quality, after which it gets published. The book reviewer reviews and publishes the same, making it LIVE on DIKSHA. If the textbook fails to achieve the criteria, reject it with comments, and the book creator needs to edit the textbook and re-submit it. Organizations/tenants can assign reviewer roles to users and set guidelines.

### Additional Notes  

   * Add multiple content creators to collaborate and assist the content creation. 
   * The creators must belong to the same tenant. 
   * The collaborator can perform all the activities of a content creator. However, only one collaborator can work on the content at a time. 
   * The book creator can add/remove the collaborators as needed.
   * The system takes up to 4 hours for book content to move from the creator’s workspace into the reviewer’s workspace.
