### Overview  

After creating the digital textbook structure, add the relevant content to every unit. These contents include book material like PDF, HTML content, videos, and assessments created and published on DIKSHA. These materials must be tagged appropriately. The digital textbook structure and the content are sent for review and published subsequently.
