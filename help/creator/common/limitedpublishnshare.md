Every organization has its own requirements for content creation and publishing. Content can be shared with all, some or specific users within or outside the organization. DIKSHA offers the features **Limited Publishing** and **Limited Sharing** that allow you to share content after it is created through a link to select audiences. All users who get the link can view the content, by logging into DIKSHA with their registered credentials. This page provides you details on how you can use these features
