## Overview

To ensure that learning objectives are met, it is important to check and reaffirm the learner’s progress at multiple logical points in the study material provided to learners. Question sets introduced at such logical points are one of the means to assess learner progress. The assessment must gather the following information:

- Marks obtained after completing a course
- Date and time to start the course
- Time to answer a question
- Attempted questions
- Complete and partially correct answers

To create a question set for your course, use the following options:

- Search for questions 
- Apply filters to narrow down the search
- [Create new question](./questionset_create.html)
- Copy an existing question
