Collection is a compilation of content. A collection can be compiled on DIKSHA using the various learning resources available on the portal or by creating content on the in-built content editor and later collating them as a collection. Registered users with content creation rights can create collections on DIKSHA. The image explains the procedure of creating a collection.
