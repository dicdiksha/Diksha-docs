## Overview

To ease the process of book creation, DIKSHA provides the feature of uploading the Table of Contents (ToC) on a .csv file. This option enables book creators to update details of the book along with its QR codes in a .csv file and upload it on the portal. The .csv file can be updated offline and uploaded on the portal when there is internet connectivity.
