## Overview 
A QR code is an image with patterns of black and white squares that can be read by electronic devices with a scanner. QR codes need to be positioned appropriately in order to make it easy for you (teacher and student) to access the relevant content. A Textbook with printed QR codes, is called an Energised Text Book(ETB). Users can use the DIKSHA app to scan the QR codes. On successful scan, the content resources linked to the QR code are downloaded on to the mobile device.
