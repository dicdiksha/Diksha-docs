## Downloading ToC

To create an energized textbook, the units/headings of the textbook must be linked to QR codes. On DIKSHA, QR codes can
be generated in three different ways:

- Enabling <b>QR code required</b> option to yes in book details screen

- Marking <b>QR code required</b> as yes in the .csv file

- Bulk generating QR codes (maximum 250)

For more details on generating and linking QR codes, refer <a href="./generate-qrcode.html" target="_blank">Generating
  QR Codes</a>. On successfully generating QR codes, the .csv file must be downloaded
