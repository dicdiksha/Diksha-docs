### Overview

- Program Dashboards are accessible to anyone who has Program Manager and Program Designer rights on DIKSHA platform. To access the program’s report, the Program Manager and Designer need to be mapped to that Program. For Eg: Program Manager A has access to the Program data, only they are mapped as a Program Manager for Program. These reports are generated on-demand based on user requests. The requested report is generated within 24 hours and can be downloaded in CSV format. Within the program Dashboard, there are 3 tabs- Program Datasets, Graphs, and Tables.

- There are 2 types of filters on the Program Dashboard- Mandatory filters and Non-mandatory filters. Program and Resource filters are Mandatory filters that must be selected for requesting any report. Non-Mandatory filers like District, Organization, Start date, and end date can be selected by users to get reports that are narrowed down to specifics.  On selecting ‘Filtered Task Detail Reports’ and ‘Status Report’, additional filters are opened up.

- In the Graphs and Tables tabs, users can get the report of any Program and its related resource in form of graphical data. The user can choose to obtain filtered data by choosing from the available filters. The graphs and tables give users district level view and can also be exported and shared.
