### Overview

Discussion topics or threads are created to discuss things related to a particular course in which the user has enrolled. It can be created only when the discussion option is enabled while creating a batch.

Users who created a batch can enable discussion forums. Once enabled, any user enrolled in a batch can initiate a discussion.

Users can view the forum option only if they are enrolled in the batch. The forum option consists of Categories, Tags, and My discussions.
