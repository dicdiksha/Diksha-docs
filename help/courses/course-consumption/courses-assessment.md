### Overview

DIKSHA Courses come with the capability to add assessment by the course content creators at the end of each Course or to each unit/module of the course. 

The user can make one or more attempts to complete it. Upon completion of the first attempt, the user gets the option to retake the assessment until they reach the permissible number of attempts for that particular course. The user cannot retake the assessment once they have exceeded the permitted number of attempts. 

After each attempt, a score is displayed based on which the users can decide whether they are satisfied with their performance or wish to retake it to get a better score. If the user has attempted multiple times, only the best score gets recorded against the course assessment.
