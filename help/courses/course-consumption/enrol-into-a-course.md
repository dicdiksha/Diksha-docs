### Overview

A logged-in user needs to enrol to a batch within a course to start consuming the same. A course can have multiple batches and only one batch is active at any given time. 

The user can enrol into an active batch to start consuming. Sometimes there is an enrollment window during which the user needs to enrol into a batch. Post this window no new enrollments are allowed. Users who have enrolled into the batch during this window can consume and complete the course content before the batch end date.
