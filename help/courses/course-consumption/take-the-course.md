### Overview

An enrolled user of the batch can start consuming the course. 

The user can monitor the progress at any given time while consuming the course. Each course has several modules and upon completion of each unit or module, the user can see a green tick mark as an indication. 

If the course has a certificate attached, then the user gets the certificate on meeting the issuance criteria.

### Additional Notes

- A course can be consumed any number of times, however the progress is updated only during the first time it is consumed. 
- A course can be consumed even after the batch to which the user enrolled has expired. However, the progress does not get updated.
