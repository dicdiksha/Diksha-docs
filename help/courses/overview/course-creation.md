### Introduction

A course on DIKSHA needs to be curated in a structured and defined manner for users to consume and avail benefits. A micro course (short and crisp) increases the usage and consumption of a course compared to a longer course. 

The first preferred step in course creation is the planning of the [course structure](../course-creation/index.html){:target="_blank"}. The course structure is the skeleton or a table of content derived from the units/topics/modules included in the course. Once the structure is created, [relevant materials are added](../course-creation/add-course-details.html){:target="_blank"} with appropriate tagging, such as Board, Medium, Grade, Audience type, and so on, to ensure easy discovery and efficient tracking. The created course then goes through a [review process](../course-creation/review-publish-course.html){:target="_blank"} after which it gets published and is then made available for users. Every published course has a unique QR code that can also be downloaded. This [course QR code](../course-creation/course-qr-code.html){:target="_blank"} helps users to scan and directly access the course without the need to do any manual search

Alternatively, a course published by the same or another organization can be reused for creating a new course by 

- Copying a published course and making necessary edits, renaming, and publishing it
- Translating a published course in the state's preferred language and publishing it
