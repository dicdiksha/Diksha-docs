### Introduction

The various learning materials are created with concise planning, are stitched together to form a course and made available on DIKSHA. These materials can be pooled or created by users with appropriate roles across the nation in the form of a story, game, activity, audio, video and so on. Once the [materials are created](../course-material-creation/index.html){:target="_blank"} and [published](../course-material-creation/review-publish-course-content.html){:target="_blank"}, they then become part of DIKSHAâ€™s central repository of all digital resources which can be accessed by everyone. 

In addition to the learning materials, [course assessments](../course-material-creation/create-course-assessments.html){:target="_blank"} (optional) can also be created and [published](../course-material-creation/review-publish-course-assmnt.html){:target="_blank"} on DIKSHA and included in the course. The score obtained in the assessment can be added as one of the qualifying criteria to issue a certificate.
