### Overview

Content on DIKSHA needs to adhere to standard guidelines to ensure good quality. When a content creator creates the content and sends it for review, the reviewer needs to verify the content for its appropriateness & usability aspects to ensure quality, after which it gets published. Organizations/tenants can assign reviewer roles to a set of users and set guidelines. The content reviewer reviews and publishes and make it LIVE on DIKSHA.  

If the content fails to achieve the criteria, request changes with comments, and the creator needs to edit the content and re-submit it.
