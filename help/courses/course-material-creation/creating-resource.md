### Overview

A user with the creator’s credentials can create material or a resource through slides (presentation). Resource needs to be well planned before creating them on DIKSHA. The State Administrator needs to design the course and assign them to the creator and reviewer in the State to achieve the learning objective. The content the users create is then sent for review and publish.  

While creating a resource on DIKSHA under the State's tenant, states need to refer to the details for appropriate naming and tagging of resources on the portal. Examples can be Board, Medium, Class, Subject. Attributions to each resource are also crucial and must be known to the creators beforehand to ensure appropriate tagging of attributions.  

The resources created on DIKSHA capture its details on two levels. 
 - The primary details - while launching resource creation 
 - Additional details (along with primary details) - before sending for review and publish.
