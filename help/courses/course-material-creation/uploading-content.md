### Overview


The creator can upload any existing content created on other platforms in different formats. These contents can be in the form of YouTube videos, PDF, MP3 or MP4. The Teachers, Students, Parents or other individuals can create and save the content offline on their local system (laptop, desktop). They can send the content to the registered user with the creator role, wherein the creator can upload the content to DIKSHA
DIKSHA supports the following content formats:  

  - Video (.mp4, .webm)
  - HTML zip
  - EPUB
  - H5P
  - Document format (.pdf)
  - URLs for YouTube videos and other files

It supports a maximum of 50 MB file size.

While uploading the newly designed course on DIKSHA under the State's tenant, States need to necessarily refer to the details for appropriate naming and tagging of resources on the portal, for example- Board, Medium, Class, and Subject.

**Note**: DIKSHA validates the standard YouTube credits and licenses before it allows the upload. Users have permission to use, copy or distribute YouTube content with the regulations as per its license policy.
