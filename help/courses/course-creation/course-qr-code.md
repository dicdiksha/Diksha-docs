### Overview

Having a QR code for a course helps users scan the QR code and consume the course without much hassle. QR codes enhance

- The search and discoverability of the courses while enrolling and accessing any online courses
- The ease of running the outreach programs/campaigns for the State admins.

### Before You Begin

  </tr>
  <tr><td>What is needed to download course? </td>
  <td>A published course</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Outcome

<table>
