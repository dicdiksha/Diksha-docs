### Overview 

Once the course structure is created, the relevant content is added to every unit. These contents can be reading content, videos, assessments, and created and published on DIKSHA. The course structure and the content are sent for review and published subsequently. 

### Before You Begin

<table>
  <tr> 
  <td> Who adds the content?</td>
   <td>User with Content Creator role</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td> What is needed to add content? </td>
  <td>Content creators must publish all the content on DIKSHA. Examples resources, images, assessments, and so on </td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Outcome

<table>
 <tr><td>What will be the outcome? </td>
 <td>Course with relevant contents, ready to be sent for review</td>
  </tr>
  </table>


### Instructional Video

This video provides step-by-step instructions on how to add content to the course structure:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="width:85%;">Video</th>
    <th style="width:15%;">Download</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><video width="320" height="240" controls><source src="../video/adding-content.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></td>
    <td class="text-center"><a href="../video/adding-content.mp4" download><img src="../../../assets/imgs/icons/outline_cloud_download.png"></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

 - Ensure to procure the do-ID and the name of the content for adding the content faster and easier
