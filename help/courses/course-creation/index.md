### Overview

A course comprises structured course material arranged in logical units to provide a learning journey for the users. The logical structure helps to create a step-by-step flow of learning for the user, where:  

  - Structure is the table of contents with units/topics and relevant content in it
  - Unit is a folder with a topic that contains the content

The course structure can be created on DIKSHA in two ways:  

  - Using course editor and add relevant units and sub-units one by one 
  - Upload entire units and subunits using a CSV file with the relevant course structure 
  
In either way of creating the course structure, the relevant metadata for each unit and the course as a whole must be added to the respective sections.


### Before You Begin

<table>
  <tr><td>Who creates the course structure?</td>
   <td>User with Content Creator role</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>What is needed to create a course structure?</td>
  <td>The content creator must have a detailed course structure planned out before creating it on DIKSHA</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Outcome

<table>
 <tr><td>What will be the outcome? </td>
  <td>A defined course structure ready for adding the content</td>
  </tr>
</table>
  

### Instructional Video

The video provides step-by-step instructions on how to create course structure on DIKSHA:

- Add relevant units and subunits one by one using the course editor

<table>
<tr>
   <th style="width:85%;">Video</th>
    <th style="width:15%;">Download</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><video width="320" height="240" controls><source src="../video/course-structure-manually.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></td>
    <td class="text-center"><a href="../video/course-structure-manually.mp4" download><img src="../../../assets/imgs/icons/outline_cloud_download.png"></a></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br>

- Upload a CSV file that contains relevant units and subunits 

<table>
<tr>
   <th style="width:85%;">Video</th>
    <th style="width:15%;">Download</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><video width="320" height="240" controls><source src="../video/create-course-using-csv.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></td>
    <td class="text-center"><a href="../video/create-course-using-csv.mp4" download><img src="../../../assets/imgs/icons/outline_cloud_download.png"></a></td>
    </tr>
</table>


### Additional Notes

The creator must ensure:  

- [Course details](./add-course-details.html){:target="_blank"} and [Unit details](./add-course-details.html#unit-details){:target="_blank"} are entered correctly while creating the course structure.  
- Add correct keywords to the course, if required. Keywords are case sensitive 


### What's Next?

- Add a published [course material](./add-course-content.html){:target="_blank"} to the course structure
