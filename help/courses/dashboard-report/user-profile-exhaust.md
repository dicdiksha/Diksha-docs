### Overview

User Profile Exhaust contains the additional information of the users, such as Email and mobile number that have joined the course. This exhaust has data of users with explicit consent to share their information while enrolling for the course. Users can turn on or turn off their profile-sharing status any number of times while consuming the course. The consent status while generating the report is accounted for the instance when the exhaust is requested.
Administrators are responsible for securing users' profile information and ensuring it complies with the DIKSHA Course Terms. A password is a must while requesting the report, and use the same password to open the downloaded file.
