### Overview

The course adoption report is designed for States/Boards to contemplate the course-wise usage, enrolment and count of users who completed the course, time spent on each course, and the number of times users play the course. It enables the States and NCERT to drive targeted outcomes and demonstrate concrete progress towards achieving stated goals. It helps in assessing district-wise performance and identifying gaps in course adoption.
