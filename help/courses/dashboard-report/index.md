### Overview

A course creator or a course mentor can view course usage at a batch level on the Dashboard. The Dashboard has information about the start and the end dates and total enrolment for every batch within the course. The creator of the course or the assigned course mentor can request specific reports on the Dashboard. It takes 24 hours after the request to view and download the report. The different on-demand reports generated for the course are: [Course Progress Exhaust](./course-progress-exhaust.html){:target="_blank"}, [User Profile Exhaust](./user-profile-exhaust.html){:target="_blank"}, [Question Set Report](./question-set-report.html){:target="_blank"}
Course Progress Exhaust,  User Profile Exhaust, and Question Set Report. The requested reports have different statuses: 

  - Submitted: Request made for the report
  - Success: Reports are ready to be downloaded from the Dashboard
  - Pending: Reports are requested and yet to be received
  - Failure: Requested reports can not be generated
