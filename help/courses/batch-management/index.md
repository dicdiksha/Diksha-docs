### Overview

A published course is accessible to the user when a batch is created in the course. Batches help the user get the below details,

  - a timeline for enrolling in a particular course 
  - a timeline for consuming a course  
  - a discussion forum for communication between the users  
  - issuing certificates to the users meeting the criteria, and so on.  

Users can select a particular course and enroll themselves in a suitable batch to complete the course. A batch can be ongoing, upcoming, or expired.
