### Overview

Certificates can be re-issued for an already issued certificate using the userâ€™s DIKSHA ID or UUID.

Certificates are re-issued because of a human error like a typographical error in the user name. Once the name is updated, certificates can be re-issued using the user's DIKSHA ID or UUID
