### Overview

Users can log in to DIKSHA using multiple methods. Logging in with a Gmail address is one of them. The benefit of using a Gmail address is the user need not provide the Gmail credential every time they log in.

When the user logs in with Gmail credentials, the year of birth should also be selected. Based on the year of birth, an OTP is sent to the user’s Gmail address for verification. The generated OTP which is active for 30 minutes, is used to verify the registration details and activate the account. The consent is given by a parent or a guardian when the user is less than 18 years old, and hence It is recommended to register using the parent’s Gmail address. For users above 18 years, the verification has to be done by the user itself, and hence their own Gmail address can be used for registration
