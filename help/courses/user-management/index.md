### Overview

DIKSHA offers a wide range of content such as textbooks, courses, tv lessons, explanation content, and so on that can be accessed by the guest or an anonymous user. However, a signed-in user can perform more activities like enrolling in courses, participating in discussion forums, and so on.

The self-sign-up initiates verification of the mobile number or email along with the consent for registration. The OTP is sent to the user through SMS or email, based on the chosen option. The generated OTP which is active for 30 minutes, is used to verify the registration details and activate the account. The consent is given by a parent or a guardian when the user is less than 18 years old, and hence It is recommended to register using the parent’s mobile number or email ID. For users above 18 years, the verification has to be done by the user itself, and hence their own mobile number or email id can be used for registration
