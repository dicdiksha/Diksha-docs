#### What is taxonomy? Why do you need to tag content using the taxonomy provided?

A taxonomy is a pre-determined classification that provides an unambiguous conceptual framework. The classification describes and separates mutually exclusive categories and subcategories of topics. Taxonomies help individuals and search engines find and retrieve information and content.

When you tag your content appropriately with the given taxonomy, it gets correctly classified. This helps anyone find your content using either the search tool or navigating to it manually.

#### What categories of tags or metadata does DIKSHA support?

DIKSHA supports five broad categories of tags or metadata: 

<ul>
<li>Metadata that describes the content</li>
<li>File related metadata</li><li>Ownership and audience metadata</li>
<li>Metadata related to the content package</li>
<li>Additional or user-defined metadata</li>
</ul>

<b>Note</b>: For details of metadata for each content unit, refer to the answer of the next question.

#### What metadata does the content provider enter for each piece of content?

DIKSHA Metadata is a set of fields that must be entered by creators or content providers prior to submission of content for review. The metadata pronounces and gives detailed information about the content in DIKSHA.

The labels used for filling out metadata text boxes are self-explanatory. The fields marked with (​*) ​ are mandatory and others are optional. The following is metadata for different content types and their respective subtypes: 

<p><b>Course Metadata</b></p>

#### How can the content provider add taxonomy and use it?

Currently, content providers cannot add their own taxonomy.


#### Is there an Organization page for content providers?

Currently, DIKSHA supports individual pages for organizations such as states and NGOs. To add an organization homepage:

<ul>
<li>Write an email to content.ntp@centralsquarefoundation.org, with the subject as ‘Request for custom home page</li>
<li>The team will respond with recommendations and a checklist.</li>
<li>Create your own static design in html.</li>
<li>Send the html page to content.ntp@centralsquarefoundation.org</li>
<li>The team will create and integrate it within the portal</li>
<li>After it is integrated, the team will share the unique url with the organization.</li>
<li>Typically, the url for the organization’s home page will be https://ntp.net.in/*contentprovider*</li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> Home page serves as the entry point for any website.

#### What is a Framework?

In the context of DIKSHA, the framework is a string of vocabularies arranged to achieve a learning outcome. The focus of the framework is not the content within it, but the sequencing of the objectives or vocabulary such that it achieves the stated outcome. The framework helps the system recommend prerequisite, next or related content to the learner.

#### How many frameworks does DIKSHA support?

DIKSHA currently supports 4 frameworks based on the following framework types:

<ul>
<li>Teacher Competency eg. CENTA, B.Ed,</li>
<li>Curriculum Framework eg. NCF, NCERT, ICSE, CBSE</li>
</ul>

<p>The frameworks supported are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Tags Framework</li>
<li>Teacher Development Framework</li>
<li>Grade Framework</li>
<li>Perspectives Framework</li>
</ul>

All content will be mapped to the vocabulary in this framework. If the same or related vocabulary are also present in other frameworks the content will appear there as well.

#### How does DIKSHA use taxonomy, metadata and frameworks?

Taxonomy on DIKSHA comprises of three layers viz.- Vocabulary layer, Content Layer and Framework Layer. It is used by the system to arrange, suggest and search for content from its repository. Each content unit is associated with multiple tag words that are part of DIKSHA’s vocabulary. Each vocabulary word can be part of one or multiple frameworks. DIKSHA celebrates the diversity of frameworks that caters to different needs and encourages it’s co-existence through this model. This model has been designed to make the platform more user friendly by improving the search ability and discoverability through these layers.


#### Can you create your own framework or tag content to other people’s framework?

Yes. States and content organisation administrators can create their own frameworks to tag their content. They can also tag their content to other frameworks as and when applicable. The system has the intelligence to associate the tags and link content to different frameworks, based on the vocabulary used to tag the content.


#### How can you contribute to taxonomy?

<p>The easiest way to contribute is to ensure that all your content is tagged appropriately and is linked to the right framework and vocabulary.</p>

<ul> 
<li>If you are unable to find suitable vocabulary to tag your content, add the word in the additional fields column.</li> 
<li>If you need to correct or recommend a tag for a content piece, suggest a word to help populate the vocabulary list.</li> 
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> This feature is not currently available, but is planned.</p>
<p>Organization and State administrators are responsible for building relevant and contextualized frameworks</p>

#### Can you build a framework on DIKSHA?

To create a framework on DIKSHA, you should have the design or layout of concepts and their purpose. In other words, you need to have a step by step layout of the vocabulary.

#### How do I create a vocabulary list?

<p>Listing out all the broad concepts that your content covers, helps you arrive at the vocabulary list. The vocabulary can include the concept and the tag words can cover the micro-concepts. For example;</p>
<p><b>Vocabulary:</b> Addition</p>
<p><b>Tags:</b> Addition with carryover, 2 digit addition</p>

#### What is the need for multiple frameworks and not a unified standard framework?

Education caters to the beauty of diversity. Each learner has a different style, pace and purpose of learning, though the outcome is more or less aligned . Frameworks cater to these diverse needs. For example; a topic like longitude could be taught as part of Geography in one framework, but as part of Adventure in another framework.
