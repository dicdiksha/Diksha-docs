#### How do I access the TEXTBOOK in DIKSHA Mobile App?

You can access the Textbooks in the DIKSHA Mobile App by following ways:
1. Open the DIKSHA App and tap **Library**. The library page displays the textbooks and other contents for a particular board, medium, and class. You can set your default board, medium, and grade while creating your profile in the app.
 
2. Open DIKSHA App and tap the Scan icon to scan the QR Code printed on your physical textbook. Once the scan is successful, the textbook will appear on the mobile.

#### How can I upload content using the app?

The DIKSHA Mobile App is only for Consumption. You cannot create or upload contents using the App. If you have **Content Creator** role (a user role is assigned by state/school authorities), then you can log in to DIKSHA portal (https://diksha.gov.in) and create content.

#### Why I am unable to see my profile settings?

This is caused by an outdated version of **Android System Webview** component on your phone. To update the webview use:  
1. Google Playstore 
2. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview link.

This solves the issue of profile setting not appearing on the DIKSHA App.
