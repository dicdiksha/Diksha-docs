### Overview

Observations are created and updated by the content creator using a template. After the filled template is sent over email to the <a href="mailto:surveysupport@teamdiksha.org" target="_blank">DIKSHA Support Team</a>, the team then uploads the observation on DIKSHA.

Observation without rubrics is a simple questionnaire. Content creators can specify multiple criteria in an observation without rubric. There are 4 tabs in the template for Observation without rubric- Instructions, Details, Criteria, Questions.The template is color-coded for description of columns, mandatory fields, optional fields, and conditionally optional fields, so that the content creator knows what to fill.
