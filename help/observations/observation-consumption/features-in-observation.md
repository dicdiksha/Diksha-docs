### Overview

- An observation questionnaire has different kinds of questions and features that can be used to navigate through the questionnaire.

- Observations can be saved before submitting to save the progress of responses filled. Users can come back to saved responses at any point before submitting the observation.

- After all the questions have been answered in an Observation, the **Submit** button gets enabled, and users can submit the observation.

- Users can download an observation to be filled offline. The observation can be saved offline and submitted when an internet connection is available. Downloaded observations can be accessed using the **Download** tab in the bottom navigation panel of DIKSHA app.
