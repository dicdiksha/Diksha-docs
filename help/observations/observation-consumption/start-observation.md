### Overview

- The Observation forms are designed to capture data for a certain entity (entity is the district, block, or school that is mapped to the user based on the role that is selected on the profile). Thus, entities can be selected for observation, followed by filling up a questionnaire to record all data for that entity. On selecting an observation, users are prompted to select an entity on the entity page.

- Observations with Rubric have Domains and questionnaires linked to each domain. Domains are the different areas of focus that the observation wants to record information about. Each domain has its observation questionnaire.

- Same observation can be filled and submitted multiple times for an entity  (entity is the district, block, or school that is mapped to the user based on the role that is selected on the profile). All observation instances of an entity can be viewed on the same page.
