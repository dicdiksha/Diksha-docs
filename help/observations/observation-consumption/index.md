### Overview  

- DIKSHA Observations are created by Content Creator and can be viewed by signed-in users who are logged in as HT & Officials or teacher profiles.

- Users can access their mapped Observations using the portal as well. The Observations on the portal are also available for the targeted users only (HT & Officials and Teachers).

- **HT and Officials** can access Observations on the App through observation tile, link, or QR code.

- **Teachers** can access Observations using the Observation tile in the **Browse other categories** section, through links and QR codes, provided it is enabled for the board selected in the profile.
