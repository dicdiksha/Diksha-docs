### Introduction to Observations

Observations are a set of questionnaires that are specific to a particular entity (such as a school block or cluster). Observations can be recorded at multiple instances, whenever necessary, and can be accessed by users who select their role as a **Teacher** or **HT and officials** in their profile. On DIKSHA, **Content Creators** can create 3 kinds of Observations: 


- **Observation with Rubric**: These Observations allow creators to specify specific domains and criteria for the Observation and set scores for each criterion. Based on the scores users get on taking up an Observation, they are shown the level (L1, L2, L3) their school is at concerning the Observation that was conducted.

- **Observation without Rubric**: It is a simple questionnaire without any domains.

- **Observation-Led Improvements**: These are Observations with rubrics with Improvement Projects mapped to each level. Users get suggestions for starting an Improvement Project based on the level they are at after completing the Observation.  


On DIKSHA, content creators create the observation using a template. Creators can:  

- Upload Observations to record different objectives. 
- Target Observations to specific entities (blocks, clusters).
- Add a variety of question types.
- Allow attachment of evidence to specific questions.
- Add relevant hints and tips to prompt users on how to answer the question.
- Set dependent questions that carry users to the next question based on their response selected.
- Set domains and criteria to Observations and decide the scoring. 
- Attach suggestive improvement projects to Observations.

On DIKSHA, any logged-in user can use the Observations. Users can:

- Start Observations. 
- Record Observations at multiple instances. 
- Attach files as evidence.
- Check the progress status of Observations.
- Navigate from one page of Observation to another through a questionnaire map.
- Answer questions based on the mentioned hints and tips.
- Save and preview the form before submission.
- Download Observation for offline viewing after completion. 
- View Observation-wise or entity-wise report. 
- Start improvement project suggested at the end of an Observation report.
- Download and share Observation report as PDFs with anyone.
