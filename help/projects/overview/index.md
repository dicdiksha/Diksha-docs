### Introduction to Improvement Projects

An improvement project enables leaders to define and track a set of easy and obtainable tasks that allow users to achieve specific objectives toward improving schools. Content Creators create the Projects on DIKSHA on a template mailed to the DIKSHA team through a registered email ID. Projects can be accessed by users who select their role as a **Teacher** or **HT & Officials** in their profile. 

Content creators create a Project using a template. Content creators can:  
- Set the objective for the Project.
- Breakdown Project into actionable micro tasks.
- Define the timelines and duration.
- Add relevant learning resources to the tasks or Project.
- Attach observations to be conducted by users.
- Mark the tasks as mandatory for compulsory non-editable tasks.
- Add a certificate to the project.
- Add issuance criteria for the certificate.

Any logged-in user can use the Projects. Users can: 
- Start the Projects.
- Edit the objective, duration, or tasks as per need.
- Add tasks or subtasks as required.
- Mark task/subtask in progress or completed
- Attach files as evidence.
- Submit the Project post completion.
