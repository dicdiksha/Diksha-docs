### Overview

Users can receive certificates for certain projects, view Project Learning Resource, add files and remarks, and sync project to DIKSHA Database.

- Some projects have Certificates attached. The certificates are issued to users after submission  of project.
- Improvement Projects may have learning resources that help users gain a broader understanding before starting a project. Learning Resources are not mandatory to be taken up for the completion of the project.

- Users can add multiple evidences as images, videos, PDF files, and links to each task. Any specific remarks can also be typed. 

- Users can sync their project to the cloud or server by clicking on the **Sync** button. Syncing means uploading the project details to the DIKSHA Database. Without syncing a project, the data is only saved on the user's device. In case of app uninstallation or cache clearing, the project data will get deleted if it is not synced to the server. Without syncing the project, the data will also not reflect in the dashboard, and states will not receive information about project completion.
