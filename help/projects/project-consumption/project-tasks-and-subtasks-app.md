### Overview

Tasks are steps that need to be taken to complete the project. The Content Creator creates tasks, however, users can also add their tasks. Furthermore, subtasks can be added to tasks.

Tasks can be of 4 types:

- Mandatory tasks
- Tasks with observation
- Tasks with Subtasks
- Tasks with Learning Resources.
