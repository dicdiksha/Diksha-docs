### Overview

An Improvement Project is marked completed only when all its tasks and subtasks are completed. Users can check the progress of their project in the progress bar section. 

Once all tasks have been completed in an Improvement Project, the **Submit Improvement** button gets enabled, and users can submit their project. Users will be asked to upload files or evidence one final time before submitting the project. Users can choose to add more files or evidence or proceed to submit the project without it. Certificates attached to Projects will only be issued to users if the issuance criteria have been met during submission.
