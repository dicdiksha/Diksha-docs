A State administrator can upload a list of valid State users for DIKSHA. When a user signs up on DIKSHA, the system validates if the credentials submitted by the user match the credentials uploaded by the administrator. If both the credentials match, the user is verified as a state registered user. To know more refer [Uploading User](./uploading-user.html){:target="_blank"}
