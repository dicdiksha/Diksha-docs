### Merging DIKSHA ID and State user account 

There is an option to merge the registered DIKSHA logged-in user account and the verified State user account. The user’s profile course progress will be added to the merged State account.  If the logged-in user also manages other users, the profile history and the list of all the managed users will be added to and can be viewed as a combined list from the user’s State account when the two are successfully merged.  
A logged-in registered user can have a maximum of 30 managed users under their profile.
