## Overview

Reports in the program dashboard are generated on-demand based on user requests. The requested report is generated within 24 hours. Reports are dependent on the selection of the program and resources. There are four kinds of detailed reports:
- Task Detail Report
- Status Report 
- Question Report
- Domain Criteria Report

### Detailed reports:
