### Overview

- Surveys are designed to capture data for a set of targeted users.

- Surveys have multiple types of questions that allow the collection of different types of data. 

- Users can identify different Surveys through specific markings given as follows:

    - Surveys that have been completed will be marked with a green dot. 
    - Surveys that have been opened but not recorded yet are marked by yellow dots. 
    - Surveys that have expired are indicated by a grey dot.
    - Surveys that have not been opened yet appear without any dots.
