### Overview

- A Survey has different kinds of questions and features that can be used to navigate through the questionnaire. These include Single-Select, Multi-Select, Date entry, Slider type, Text only, and Number only questions. 

- Surveys can be saved before submitting to save the progress of responses filled. Users can come back to saved responses at any point before submitting the Survey.

- After all the questions have been answered in a Survey, the **Submit** button is enabled, and users can submit the Survey.

- Users can download a Survey to be filled offline. The Survey can be saved offline and submitted when an internet connection is available. Downloaded Surveys can be accessed using the **Download** tab on the bottom navigation panel of the DIKSHA app.
