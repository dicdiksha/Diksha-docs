### Overview

Surveys are created and updated by the content creator through a template. After the filled template is sent over mail to the <a href = "mailto:surveysupport@teamdiksha.org" target="_blank">DIKSHA Support Team</a>, the support team uploads the survey on DIKSHA.

DIKSHA Surveys are created by Content Creator and can be viewed only by targeted users who are logged in as HT & officials.
