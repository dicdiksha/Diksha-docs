aboutdiksha: About DIKSHA
aboutdikshacontent: DIKSHA (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing) is a  national platform for school education, an initiative of National Council for Education Research and Training (NCERT), Ministry of Education. DIKSHA was developed based on the core principles of open architecture, open access, open licensing diversity, choice and autonomy as outlined in the Strategy and Approach Paper for the National Teacher Platform released by the former Hon’ Minister for Human Resources Development Shri Prakash Javdekar in May, 2017. DIKSHA itself was launched by the Hon’ Vice President of India on Sept 5th, 2017 and  has since been adopted by 35 states/UT’s across as well as CBSE and NCERT and by crores of learners and teachers.

    DIKSHA is built on open source technology, made in India and made for India, which incorporates internet scale technologies and enables several use-cases and solutions for teaching and learning. DIKSHA is built using MIT licensed open source technology called Sunbird, which is a digital infrastructure for learning and is designed to support multiple languages and solutions and offers over a 100 micro services as building blocks for the development of platforms and solutions.
    <br><br>
    DIKSHA, as mentioned earlier, is available for the use of all states and UTs of India. Each state/UT leverages the DIKSHA platform in its own way, as it has the freedom and choice to use the varied capabilities and solutions of the platform to design and run programs for their teachers and learners. DIKSHA policies and tools make it possible for the education ecosystem (educationist, experts, organisations, institutions - government, autonomous institutions, non-govt and private organisations) to participate, contribute and leverage a common platform to achieve learning goals at scale for the country.
    <br><br>
    DIKSHA can be accessed by learners and teachers across the country and currently supports 18+ languages and the various curricula of NCERT, CBSE and SCERTs across India. The platform is being leveraged and developed for school education, foundational learning programs and to support inclusive learning for underserved and differently-abled communities of learners and teachers.
    <br><br>
    In the context of COVID-19 related disruption of schooling, DIKSHA makes it possible for all states/UT’s to enable learning/education at home through innovative state programs; hence leapfrogging the use of technology for the benefit of teachers and learners across India.

    The Honourable Prime Minister of India has launched NDEAR (National Digital Education Architecture) on 29th July 2021 which provides building blocks for development of federated and interoperable systems by States/UTs. The core building blocks of DIKSHA comprise majority of NDEAR building blocks, having enabled some successful use-cases of NDEAR such as: energized textbooks, online courses, content authoring, content sourcing, interactive quizzes, question banks, chatbot, analytics and dashboard. In the times of COVID-19 pandemic, the platform has experienced unprecedented rise in access by learners and teachers across the country.
    <br><br>
    For digital content to aid in the teaching and learning processes, a rich repository of varied resources was contributed by schools/individual teachers, content partners, NGOs, corporates under CSR under VidyaDaan against the various content requirements of NCERT/CBSE/States.
    <br><br>
    To aid teaching and learning for Children With Special Needs (CWSN), a large number of audio books, ISL (Indian Sign Language) Videos and Dictionary have been made available on DIKSHA for CWSN.
    <br><br>
    During the pandemic, the massive teacher’s professional development programme NISHTHA 1.0 (National Initiatives for School Heads and Teacher’s Holistic Advancement) for Elementary grades was launched online through DIKSHA. NISHTHA 2.0 & 3.0 focus on Secondary and Foundational Literacy and Numeracy. Apart from NISHTHA , several States/UTs have designed their own capacity building programs.
    <br><br>
    NCERT also delivers content for students on a 24x7 basis through PM eVIDYA DTH-TV channels (One Class, One Channel from classes I to XII).
