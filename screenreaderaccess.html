           <ol type="1">
            <li>
                If you are a keyboard-only user, or you use swipe gestures to navigate, you should have no trouble navigating between interactive elements – links, buttons, labels, and fields to input text using ‘tab’, arrow keys and other keystrokes or swipe gestures to navigate. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The focus area indicators, logical navigation order, heading structure, and navigation regions allow for seamless keyboard navigation:

                    <li>
                       <b> Logical navigation order  -</b> This capability enables the user to be guided through the navigation inside the application main section. Any collapsible sections & menus can be discovered by this capability.

                    <li>
                       <b> Heading structure - </b> Heading structure will define the structure of the content  for the user. It will help blind users to scan through the page and find information quickly.

                    <li>
                       <b> Navigation regions -</b> This helps markup different regions of web pages and applications, so that they can be identified by web browsers and assistive technologies. Ex: Headers, Footers, Main Content, Menu etc.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the “skip to main content” link provided at the start of every page to bypass repetitive links and other elements on each page.

        <p>Attaining complete accessibility on DIKSHA is a journey we strive towards. Towards this goal, we have taken the following steps so far:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
<li>
    <b>Testing using Accessibility Tools:</b> Team DIKSHA ran an audit on the DIKSHA web portal and mobile app using automated accessibility checking tools like WAVE, AXE and Android talkback to identify accessibility issues. The issues that were identified were then systematically fixed. This was completed in February 2021.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Expert Testing:</b> An external expert agency was then engaged to further identify the accessibility & usability issues on the DIKSHA web portal and mobile app & checking for compliance with the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 Success Criteria at Levels A and AA. The expert agency used a mix of automated testing conducted by subject matter experts as well as manual testing using specialized software tools. This was completed by July 2021. The development team thereafter spent a substantial amount of time addressing the issues identified by the expert by February 2022.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Ongoing Testing:</b> Since the 4.6.0 release of DIKSHA in February, 2022, accessibility related test cases are part of regular DIKSHA release cycles using tools like WAVE, axe-core & NVDA. This is intended to ensure that the health of the compliance levels is continuously maintained. As of June 2022, the team has carried out a comprehensive testing exercise to identify outstanding accessibility and usability issues.

<li>
   <b> User Testing:</b> In order to make DIKSHA more usable & intuitive, the next step is to undertake regular user-testing by persons with atypical needs and users of assistive technology. This exercise is being planned with blind and low vision users of DIKSHA and the feedback from this exercise will give the development team further insight into ensuring the user-experience of screen reader users & users of magnification is improved. Such user-testing if executed regularly will enable communities of such users to help make DIKSHA a more accessible & inclusive resource for all students & teachers across the country.
